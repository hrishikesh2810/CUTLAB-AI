                "Video editing is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. Creators spend hours scrubbing through raw footage to find the best moments, removing silence, and adjusting framing for different platforms (e.g., landscape for YouTube, portrait for TikTok). This manual workflow is a bottleneck for content creation.\n",

                "**CUTLAB AI** aims to democratize professional video editing by automating the most tedious parts of the process. Our goal is to build an \"AI Co-pilot\" that:\n",
                "- **Detects Scenes**: Automatically segments raw footage into meaningful clips.\n",
                "- **Understands Content**: Identifies faces, motion, and audio energy.\n",
