## 🧠 About the Project

CUTLAB AI is an intelligent video editing platform designed to assist editors by automatically analyzing video content and suggesting smart cuts, scenes, and transitions.

This project is being developed as part of an academic project associated with **IIT Ropar**, where the focus is on leveraging modern AI capabilities to simplify complex video editing workflows.

The system uses AI-based analysis to understand visual patterns, scene boundaries, and transitions — enabling faster and more efficient editing.

## 🤖 Use of AI (Antigravity)

CUTLAB AI is built using advanced AI capabilities powered by **Antigravity**, which helps in:

- Scene detection and segmentation  
- Identifying unnecessary or low-value frames  
- Suggesting optimal cuts and transitions  
- Assisting in automated editing workflows  

The AI is integrated into the processing pipeline to make intelligent decisions similar to how a human video editor would approach raw footage.
